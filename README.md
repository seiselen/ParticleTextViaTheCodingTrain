I made a Processing Implementation of The Coding Train Coding Challenge #59 - Steering Behaviors

To run the sketch, you can do one of two things:

 1) Create a new Processing Sketch, then copy and paste the code from the .pde file.
 2) Copy the pde file to a directory, then double click on it and follow the prompts that should ask if you want to create a file to store the sketch in, etc.
